Current StatusOAuth 2.0 is Enabled: The presence of the "User authentication settings" section with options for "Type of App" and "App permissions" confirms that OAuth 2.0 is activated for this app ("1965789942820532225Mirancourt"). This is a good sign, as it supports the authentication flow Replit likely uses.
App Type: You’ve selected "Web App, Automated App or Bot" as the type, which is appropriate for a server-side integration like Replit Auth. This enables OAuth 2.0 user context flows (e.g., login).
Permissions: You’ve chosen "Read and write" permissions, which is more than the minimum needed for Replit (typically just "Read Posts and profile information" or basic "profile" scope). This is fine but might require additional approval if you exceed free-tier limits.
Email Request: The "Request email from users" option is checked, but the required privacy policy and terms of service URLs are placeholders (https://). Replit might need a valid email scope, so this needs attention.
Redirect URI: You’ve set https://api.mirancourt.com/auth/x/callback as the callback URL. This must match exactly what Replit expects during the OAuth flow. If Replit uses a different redirect (e.g., a Repl-specific URL like https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/auth/callback), it won’t work until updated.

Troubleshooting for Replit ConnectionBased on your earlier frustration with connecting X to Replit, here’s what might be going wrong and how to fix it:Redirect URI Mismatch:Replit Auth likely expects its own callback URL (e.g., tied to your Repl’s domain like *.replit.dev or a custom domain if deployed). The current URL (https://api.mirancourt.com/auth/x/callback) might be for a different project.
Fix: Check Replit’s documentation or the error message during the login attempt to find the expected redirect URI. Update this field in the X app settings to match (e.g., https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/auth/callback). You can add multiple URIs with the "+ Add another URI / URL" option if needed. Save changes after updating.
Invalid Privacy/Terms URLs:The placeholder https:// for privacy policy and terms of service won’t pass X’s validation. These are required if you’re requesting email access.
Fix: Provide valid URLs (e.g., create simple pages on a site like GitHub Pages or use generic templates). For testing, you could use https://your-username.github.io/privacy or a Replit-hosted page. Save and retest the connection.
App Approval Status:Since you’re on the free tier (0% usage), your app might need review for "Read and write" permissions, especially if Replit tries to use write access. This can delay authentication.
Fix: Monitor the app status in the Developer Portal dashboard. If it’s under review, wait for approval or adjust to "Read Posts and profile information" to minimize scrutiny.
Replit Configuration:If you’re using Replit Auth in a custom app, ensure the Client ID (from the "Keys and tokens" tab in X) is correctly set in your Repl’s environment variables or code.
Fix: In your Repl, go to the "Secrets" tab, add your X Client ID and Client Secret, and update your app code to use them (Replit Agent can generate this if you prompt it).
Next StepsUpdate Redirect URI: Change it to match your Replit app’s callback URL. Test with Replit’s login flow afterward.
Fix Privacy/Terms URLs: Add valid links to save the settings.
Retest Connection: Go to Replit’s login or Connected Services, select X, and authorize again.
Check Errors: If it fails, note the exact error (e.g., "Invalid redirect URI" or "401 Unauthorized") and share it with me.

Your OAuth 2.0 setup is alive and mostly configured—tweaking the redirect and URLs should get you connected! Let me know how it goes or if you need help with the next step.
